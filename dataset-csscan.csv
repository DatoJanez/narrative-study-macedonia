One of the need express a need for training of trainers in emergency preparedness and response and more broadly in capacity building in that sector. It has difficult to find the fund at the CP and the Regional level. And finally we agree to move to combine several Caritas offices if this is an expressed need from multiple Caritae ( e.g. GB Senegal CV) and investing in this as a real means to increase local caritas capacity to respond; training neighboring caritas offices could also create a peer network and allow not only for experience sharing and learning but possible south-south solidarity and support when an emergency strikes. After one year discussion nothing happened. At the same time ML is providing support for EPR capacity building to Africa Caritas through HRD support. The same situation is noticeable with Caritas Internationalis /Caritas Africa DIRO (institutional development) to some African Caritas while we ML are building our PCS strategy tools and support to the same stakeholders. My concern here is how better coordination could help in carrying out highest outcomes for partners and beneficiaries.,Coordination planning budgeting,Better internal and external coordination could bring higher outcomes,,,0.19304556,0.700037,0.46642685,0.70385176,0.3297362,0.7075185,0.5935252,0.7111481,0.08033573,0.7001481,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,SenseMaker New WebCollector; Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; Media Center PC 6.0; CMNTDFJS; F9J; InfoPath.3; rv:11.0) like Gecko,,,en

The building looks like a rural primary school built to house pilgrims of the nearby Marian center. Thus despite many repairs required by ML for sufficient working conditions the bats that lived in the ceiling never left the electrical under-sizing continued to damage air conditioners that ML bought twice in the same year the site had other buildings that still receiving pilgrims with all the relevant disturbances ... In addition the rent paid was more than double the normal in the locality. ML had conceded this as part of a support to this diocese under construction.After deferring the problem to the Bishop with documented explanations ML wished to have another building from the Diocese. But there was none. Then ML suggested that he could not renew the contract.The Bishop got angry and had a bitter phone call to the CR. So a crisis took place since two months. He did not even want to continue the investigations we engaged to accompany him in developing a business plan for the agricultural exploitation of his 500 hectares of land. Apart from the rent paid regularly ML proposed to compensate the Diocese for induced gap due to the investments. But this does not calm the Bishop who consider what happened as a betrayal.We are overcome the situation but the ashes still hot. So we must rebuild our relationship.What I learned in this 2nd day of PePa2017 in terms of crucial communication in particular is very helpful for this challenge.Thank you.,Relationship emergency attitudes in PCS,The PCS staff should be involve by starting the procurment process,,,0.7853717,0.7074074,0.79016787,0.5074074,0.7853717,0.31851852,0.92206234,0.52592593,0.92206234,0.32222223,0.17386091,0.34074074,,0.63429254,0.7259259,0.76139086,0.5037037,0.94844127,0.6888889,0.941247,0.47777778,0.94844127,0.3111111,0.8333333,0.3111111,,SenseMaker New WebCollector; Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0,,,en

The sessions have been well thought out and they flow logically allowing participants to engage and gain better understanding of the topics. one challenge though is that the days are rather very long and packed thus not providing the participants with time to reflect engage informally with colleagues to gain even more knowledge. It is difficult for learners especially adults to stay engage and absorb all the days sessions. Concentration is key to learning and if the days are very long as they have been most participants lose the ability to concentrate. it is important to end the days earlier to give time for reflection and catching up with emails (as work never really stops when attending trainings) and most importantly free time to recoup.,logical flow of sessions time to reflect on days learning and reasonable time schedule to ensure concentration is not lost.,Working with a new organization the partner staff were stretched thinly and expected me to do their job for them instead of learning and doing the job themselves,,,0.9276499,0.3148148,0.9180576,0.49270368,0.92285377,0.6556296,0.812542,0.3025185,0.7981535,0.66062963,0.83014387,0.48525923,,0.93721825,0.28029633,0.9356594,0.4334445,0.91964024,0.5914444,0.9244604,0.7123704,0.8333333,0.32237035,0.81414866,0.52477777,,SenseMaker New WebCollector; Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; rv:11.0) like Gecko,,,en
